# Rescued by Recolic

This project is recovered from <https://web.archive.org/web/20210609033716/https://github.com/gmastergreatee/ExternalCrosshairOverlay> and <https://github.com/tweakrrr/ECO>. gmastergreatee has deleted his whole github account, RIP. 

**Thanks to @tweakrrr**. Without his fork, we would have lost this awesome crosshair overlay. This is almost the **only tool** to allow you to overlay a custom PNG, without any scaling. This allows you to create a high-quality firing table overlay, to use your sniper rifle like mortar! 

I will help releasing latest binaries, and accepting issues and pull requests, just like the original project.

Simple external crosshair overlay, requires .Net v4.5

In some games like CSGO, this will work on fullscreen-windowed/windowed mode only.
Whereas in games like UT2004, all display modes will be supported.

Download [here](https://github.com/gmastergreatee/ExternalCrosshairOverlay/releases/latest).

## Features

- [x] custom sized crosshair
- [x] choose crosshair color(for primary crosshair only)
- [x] change crosshair transparency
- [x] display crosshair on selected process
- [x] entirely in C# (no DirectX dependencies)
- [x] supports custom crosshair option(png/jpeg images - other formats experimental)
- [x] set the crosshair offset manually(__Hotkey : "-"(Minus key) [Movement: Arrows/WASD]__)
- [x] saving of configuration based on the target game

#### Note : Configs are stored at `%APPDATA%\CrosshairOverlay` folder. Delete files to hard-reset the config.

### Crosshair Scaling by lower values

To make minor adjustments, focus the slider by clicking it, then press the buttons left/right arrow keys(or up/down) 
It should change by 0.01 points in that case, whereas clicking on either side of the slider with mouse should change by 0.1 points

### Notice (16 Jan, 2019)
__ECO__ was developed as a prototype. Therefore, there will be no further enhancements to the app __AFTER__ milestone 0.2.2 is reached.

__Feature requests are still welcome.__
