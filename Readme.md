Simple external crosshair overlay, requires .Net v4.5

In some games like CSGO, this will work on fullscreen-windowed/windowed mode only.
Whereas in games like UT2004, all display modes will be supported.

### Crosshair Scaling by lower values

To make minor adjustments, focus the slider by clicking it, then press the buttons left/right arrow keys(or up/down) 
It should change by 0.01 points in that case, whereas clicking on either side of the slider with mouse should change by 0.1 points
